###How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub

###Create a Copy of the Repository

In order to work on an open-source project, you will first need to make your own copy of the repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

####Fork the Repository
You can fork a repository on GitHub by navigating with your browser to the GitHub URL of the open-source project you would like to contribute to.
GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name. For example, DigitalOcean Community is the owner of the cloud_haiku project repository, so the GitHub URL for that project is:

**https://github.com/do-community/cloud_haiku**

In the above example, **do-community** is the username and **cloud_haiku** is the repository name.
